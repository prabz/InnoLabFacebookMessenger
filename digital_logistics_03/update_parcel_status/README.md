# Update Parcel Status

## Configuration

This lambda needs `FB_ACCESS_TOKEN` set as an environment variable. It is generated by a Facebook App for a specific Facebook Page.

## Known issues

Due to claudia's `fbSend` method implementation, it can take more than the default 3 seconds for the lambda to complete. To prevent timeout, increase limit to 10 seconds (AWS Dashboard -> Lambda -> Function -> [lambda function] -> Configuration -> Basic Settings -> Timeout).
