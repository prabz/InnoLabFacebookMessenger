## Pricing

Dialogflow is available in two editions: standard and enterprise. While the standard edition is free of any charge, the enterprise edition is charged on a per request basis. In return, it has a higher throughput (10 instead of 3 queries per second) and comes with an SLA. However, the enterprise edition is based on the new Dialogflow V2 API which is currently in beta phase.
